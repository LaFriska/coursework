        <p>
            Mao Zedong launched the Hundred Flowers Campaign in 1956, encouraging liberalisation,
            and criticism of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). However, an Anti-Rightist Movement
            was then launched, purging ~550,000 people who spoke out.<a class="cite" onclick="animate()" href="#king"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
            Mao’s intent of the
            Hundred Flowers Campaign is disputed. Therefore, the question “to what extent was Mao’s
            Hundred Flowers campaign launched for a later political purge?” is explored in this
            assessment.
            <br><br>
            <em>On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People</em> is a speech by Mao Zedong, <a
                class="cite" href="#maoCont"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
            relevant for this investigation as it contains Mao’s justification for the two consecutive
            movements, providing Mao’s reasonings behind them. <em>The Search for Modern China</em> is
            an academic history book by Jonathan Spence<a class="cite" href="#spence"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, relevant for
            this investigation as it provides
            formal historical analysis of the intent behind the campaign. It has a valuable examination
            from a professional in the field.
            <br><br>
            A value of the speech’s content is that it has an analysis of the situation in China 1956 —
            and reasons why the Hundred Flowers campaign might have been launched.<a class="cite" href="#maoCont"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
            A value of the origin
            is that because Mao — the leader of the campaign — wrote it, it provides Mao’s own
            perspectives on the matter, without external judgement and speculations;<a class="cite"
                                                                                       href="#maoCont"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
            we can cross-examine
            his perspective with others’. A value of its purpose is that because Mao also intended to
            publish the speech publically,<a class="cite" href="#fremantle"><sup>[6]</sup></a> it provides valuable
            insight on what the people have been
            told by the government regarding the Hundred Flowers Campaign, informing us on what the
            Chinese people know — or do not know at the time. A limitation of its purpose is it might
            have been intended to bait out the Chinese rightists for the political purge, not reflecting
            Mao’s true intentions, limiting our understanding of the intent behind the campaign.
            A limitation of its origin is that it was written in 1956,<a class="cite" href="#maodoc"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
            it does not have the advantage
            of historical hindsight, limiting its information. A limitation of contents is that its
            explanations tend to be implicit. There are vague metaphors such as “poisonous weeds”,
            and Mao’s definitions of them are disputed.<a class="cite" href="#maoCont"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
            <br><br>
            A value of Spence’s book’s origin is that the author is a professional historian; the
            information is thus credible. A value of its purpose is it was intended to examine and inform
            modern Chinese history. Thus, it provides key information for the Hundred Flowers Campaign.
            A value of its content is that it contains facts and also Spence’s own view on the matter,
            contributing to this investigation’s diverse range of standpoints. A limitation of its content
            is that there is little acknowledgement of other historians’ perspectives in the book,
            and many nullifications of their views are not substantiated; thus, it is harder
            to understand Spence’s view. A limitation of its origin is that Spence is American.
            Therefore, his views on China might have been unbalanced by the anti-communist
            political zeitgeist. Finally, a limitation of its purpose is that it was intended
            to examine a broader scope of Chinese history of ~400 years. Therefore, there is
            little depth in a short campaign’s analysis.

        <h2>Section B - Investigation</h2>
        <div id="B1">
            <h3>Intended as a Trap</h3>
            <p>
                Arguably, Mao intended the campaign to trap political opponents. “Few guessed that Mao
                was setting a trap, … so that he could use what they said to victimise them,” wrote
                Jung Chang, a Chinese-British critic.<a class="cite" href="#changUnknown"><sup>[9]</sup></a> Chang’s
                argued that Mao intended to trap those
                who spoke out, to consolidate his power. Frank Dikötter, a historian, claimed:
                “Mao was planning a counter-attack, and asked the propaganda machine to encourage
                more people to come out and criticise the party”.<a class="cite" href="#dikotter"><sup>[10]</sup></a> He
                argued Mao used his influence and
                propaganda to bait the intellectuals — and purge them. Chang and Dikötter’s arguments
                are reasonable, as during the Chinese Civil War, Mao exercised similar methods of
                consolidation<a class="cite" href="#bianco"><sup>[11]</sup></a>, so that most if not all must conform to
                Mao Zedong Thought.
                Perhaps Mao desired a wider version of the Yan’an Rectification?
                <br><br>
                Prior to the Anti-Rightist Movement, Mao himself also stated that the campaign was a plot
                for a political purge: “How can we catch the snake if we don’t let it come out?” said Mao at
                the Hankow conference.<a class="cite" href="#maoHankow"><sup>[12]</sup></a> The fact that Mao — being
                the leader in question — confirmed this intent
                is strong evidence for the idea that he launched the campaign for a political purge. However,
                this may not reflect his initial intentions, as Mao’s ideas have always been inconsistent,<a
                    class="cite" href="#spence"><sup>[13]</sup></a>
                and the metaphorical “snake” is subjective. Thus, the initial intent is still debatable.
                <br><br>
                To thoroughly understand this view, we must also examine Mao’s thought process. Mao likely
                desired rectification for Chinese thinking, as he installed an ideology defining correct living
                standards, and wanted to eliminate the “individualist” and “bourgeois” culture. “Nothing is
                ‘nonpolitical’” writes Arthur Doak Barnett<a class="cite" href="#barnett"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Barnett
                claimed that the party wanted complete
                control over his people, including the thinking of intellectuals.<a class="cite" href="#barnett"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
                Deng Xiaoping also acknowledged
                the mistake of launching the campaign for a purge after Mao’s death.<a class="cite"
                                                                                       href="#qi"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
                Therefore, the intent may
                be evident in the party’s earlier actions — to assert a totalitarian control. Furthermore,
                after the Hundred Flowers campaign, Mao eliminated not just those who created dissent, as
                initially suggested, but also many who provided the formerly encouraged constructive criticism.<a
                    class="cite" href="#ying"><sup>[17]</sup></a>
                Thus, it is very possible that this narrative is true.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="B2">
            <h3>Intended to Accept Criticism and Bait “Poisonous Weeds”</h3>
            <p>
                Mao distinguished the intellectuals by “fragrant flowers” and “poisonous weeds”.
                This botanical metaphor separated criticism of party mistakes, and counter-revolutionary
                threats.<a class="cite" href="#maoBeatBack"><sup>[18]</sup></a> Arguably, Mao desired to encourage the
                former and eliminate the latter.
                Mao never denied his will to purge the “poisonous weeds”, arguing that bourgeois
                sentiments topple socialism: “The Rightists want us to … take the capitalist road”<a class="cite"
                                                                                                     href="#maoCont"><sup>[19]</sup></a>
                wrote Mao in <em>On the Correct … the People</em>, “but we should carefully distinguish
                between poisonous weeds and fragrant flowers”.<a class="cite" href="#maoCont"><sup>[20]</sup></a> Thus,
                Chang’s arguments were potentially
                misinterpretations, as she did not consider the distinction,<a class="cite" href="#changUnknown"><sup>[21]</sup></a>
                while Mao killed two birds
                with one stone, correcting party mistakes while also purging anti-party rightists. However,
                despite his clarification, Mao’s metaphors are vague. Thus, the extent of an individual
                considered a rightist is unclear, meaning that it could have been a trap depending on his
                definitions.
                <br>
                The plausibility of liberalisation is further strengthened through Mao’s positive views
                concerning Krushchev’s policy of “de-Stalinisation”, advocating repudiations against Stalinist
                totalitarianism.<a class="cite" href="#khruschchev"><sup>[22]</sup></a> According to Pavel Yudin, a
                diplomat who interviewed Mao, Mao criticised
                Stalin’s totalitarian style, and wanted to adopt Khrushchev’s liberalism in China.<a class="cite"
                                                                                                     href="#yudin"><sup>[23]</sup></a>
                Therefore,
                Khrushchev potentially triggered Mao’s realisation of the need for a liberal approach to
                develop China. However, the Sino-Soviet Rift suggests that Mao actually disliked Khrushchev’s
                ideas,<a class="cite" href="#vimla"><sup>[24]</sup></a> this standpoint is therefore questionable — as
                Mao potentially did not reveal
                his true intentions in that interview.
                <br>
                If Mao followed Khrushchev’s ruling approach, it is plausible that the Eastern European
                uprisings incited Mao to take action in China. David Teszar, a researcher, compared the
                two consecutive movements to the Hungarian uprising in 1956, arguing that Mao believed
                Stalinist rectification would create dissent — similar to Hungary, but encouraging
                criticism is the correct way to rectify. Teszar implied that Mao did not intend to
                purge intellectuals, but dissent brewed, with more “poisonous weeds” than he expected.<a class="cite"
                                                                                                         href="#teszar"><sup>[25]</sup></a>
                Thus, the comparison between China and Hungary is vital — as Chinese leaders followed
                the USSR policies and their consequences as examples<a class="cite" href="#spence"><sup>[26]</sup></a> —
                to make correct decisions.
                Later, Mao — horrified by the shaky events of Poznań and Hungary, and its similarities in
                China — wanted to suppress counter-revolutionary activities similar to Khruschev’s actions
                in Eastern Europe.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="B3">
            <h3>Intended to Develop Chinese Literature and Arts</h3>
            <p>
                Arguably, Mao initially encouraged China’s artistic and literary prosperity,
                with no intent to trap critics or counter-revolutionaries. Mao potentially
                believed — the only way to do so is alleviate socialist influence on artists
                and authors. This is backed by the contemporary CCP, written in an article:
                “[The Hundred Flowers Campaign was] the method to prosper literature and art”,<a class="cite"
                                                                                                 href="#ccpnews"><sup>[27]</sup></a>
                and also Mao: “[Hundred Flowers Campaign] was put forward … to speed up its
                economic and cultural development.” This is believable, as Mao, being a poet
                himself<a class="cite" href="#maoPoems"><sup>[28]</sup></a> likely understood the necessity of artistic
                freedom to progress culture.
                The later purge was therefore a reactionary movement as the CCP felt threatened
                by the flagrant aggression from the intellectuals. However, this contradicts
                with Mao’s initial statement arguing the campaign intended for a trap; thus,
                Mao’s argument is questionable. Zhou Yang, an official of arts in the CCP,
                justified the later purge: “The bourgeois rightists … [are] trying to change our
                literature and art in accordance with their world outlook and aesthetic theory”,<a class="cite"
                                                                                                   href="#zhou"><sup>[29]</sup></a>
                implying that the will to purge only came after the dissent. Many historians like
                Szczepanski — would agree.<a class="cite" href="#szczepanski"><sup>[30]</sup></a> Therefore, Mao likely
                desired a Western-styled artistic
                progressivism, but rejected revisionist roads to capitalism, of which many
                intellectuals misconceived and took — leading to the needs of suppression.
                <br>
                Another reason for cultural liberalisation was the rectification of the film
                industry prior, when many “rightist” films were attacked.<a class="cite" href="#barnett"><sup>[31]</sup></a>
                Isabel Hilton, a journalist,
                argued that the film industry's rectification suppressed counter-revolutionary
                expressions to such extent — that it gave Mao confidence in liberalisation.<a class="cite"
                                                                                              href="#hilton"><sup>[32]</sup></a>
                Spence argued <em>The Life of Wu Xun</em>, a film publicly denounced for being bourgeoisie,
                causing a nation-wide hype of hatred incited Mao’s reevaluation of totalitarianism.<a class="cite"
                                                                                                      href="#spence"><sup>[33]</sup></a>
                With a significant lack of progress in the film industry, the CCP potentially
                reevaluated their ideology, resolving to cultural liberalisation. The unexpected
                intensity of attacks — may have pushed Mao to launch the Anti-Rightist Movement,
                to suppress the upheaval.
                <br>
                One could argue that the Anti-Rightist Movement is caused by the shift in the Chinese
                leadership’s inner conflict over the way they should deal with the hopeless intellectuals.
                Spence wrote: “The Hundred Flowers campaign was not a plot by Mao to reveal the hidden
                rightists in his country … It was, rather, a muddled and inconclusive movement that grew
                out of conflicting attitudes within the CCP leadership”.<a class="cite"
                                                                           href="#spence"><sup>[34]</sup></a> Perhaps
                Mao was influenced
                by the short-lived popularity of liberalising culture, causing Mao to change his mind
                and unintentionally making it appear to be a trap.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="B4">
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Undeniably, Mao knew that rightists may seize the opportunity to pose a threat
                to the government; thus, Mao’s distinction between “flowers” and “weeds” were initially
                between criticism and counter-revolutionary revisionism, Mao wanted to suppress the
                counter-revolutionaries, but he had no intention to use the Hundred Flowers Campaign
                as a trap to lure them out. A liberalisation of Chinese literature and arts is the
                main intent, as the suppression of Chinese films disillusioned the leadership, a
                cause that significantly outweighs any political rectification incentives,
                and China had already efficiently rectified prior. It was therefore the fault of
                the hot-blooded people who took liberalisation too far that caused the necessity for
                the purge, and as Spence suggested, the CCP’s inner conflicts, as political beliefs
                shifted from a debate on dealing with Chinese intellectuals, muddled to to an agreement
                to suppress the upheaval. Because following Khrushchev’s ideas contradicts with the
                Sino-Soviet rift — as Mao despised Khrushchev’s liberalism, Yudin’s interview with
                Mao probably did not represent Mao’s true intentions of the campaign. However,
                the Eastern European uprisings, along with local similarities — certainly
                strengthened the incentives to launch the Anti-Rightist Movement.

        <h2>Section C - Reflection </h2>
        <p>
            Throughout, I realised many problems faced by historians. Due to the still-prevailing
            CCP, many primary sources from China are classified thus — limiting my investigation
            on Chinese perspectives. The remaining few sources like <em>On the Correct … People</em> were
            difficult to find — due to their strict accessibility. Furthermore, Chinese historians
            are significantly influenced by the CCP — critical discussions in China are severely limited.
            Michael Lynch, an historian, mentioned that the Cultural Revolution and the Tian’anmen
            Square Massacre made people unwilling to critically thinking, accepting a general,
            collectivised view without deductive reasoning — unlike Western historians.<a class="cite"
                                                                                          href="#lynch"><sup>[35]</sup></a>
            This was why many secondary Chinese sources like the CCP article<a class="cite"
                                                                               href="#ccpnews"><sup>[36]</sup></a>
            generally told the same
            narrative, and I learned that historians need to cross-examine these sources. Furthermore,
            I understood the necessity to find appropriate — and credible translations, for sources
            like Mao’s speeches<a class="cite" href="#maoCont"><sup>[37]</sup></a> and Deng Xiaoping’s hindsight,<a
                class="cite" href="#qi"><sup>[38]</sup></a> a process many historians must
            face, as the language barrier certainly makes source analysis much more difficult. I also
            learned the necessity of considering personal and political influence that affected authors.
            The Western outlook on communists states like China shifted during the Cold War, Cold War
            orthodox historians usually have a negative outlook on CCP socialism, while revisionist
            historians like Spence acknowledged their positive actions.<a class="cite"
                                                                          href="#spence"><sup>[39]</sup></a> Jung Chang
            had a negative
            view on Mao, often harshly criticised his actions, and an omission of positive arguments
            are obvious.<a class="cite" href="#changUnknown"><sup>[40]</sup></a> This however, was because Chang had a
            personal issue with Mao,
            as her parents were publicly humiliated during the Cultural Revolution.<a class="cite"
                                                                                      href="#changWild"><sup>[41]</sup></a>
            Thus, I needed to
            evaluate the problems Chang had, and cross-examine some of her views, with sources of opposing
            standpoints, such as Spence’s <em>The Search for Modern China</em>. My perspectives have also
            significantly changed, as I understood that Mao should not necessarily be
            naivly marked as evil and power-hungry for every policy they instigate, and that often —
            he simply had a different approach from Western politics. Therefore, the investigation made
            me think independantly against much of my former Western history education. Despite that,
            this investigation brought valuable insight and critical thinking skills on my understanding
            of Chinese history.
